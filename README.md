# My personal website

This was built with Next.js and deployed on Vercel.
It uses Strapi as a CMS because I was lazy, and every UI element is custom made.

This repository is not an up-to-date version of my website, but rather a snapshot of the codebase at a certain point in time.
I do way too many incremental changes, usually without coherent commit messages, so I decided to just do this.

This is licensed under the MIT license, so feel free to use it as a base for your own website. I would appreciate it if you could credit me somewhere, link back, or just send me a message saying you used it - but you don't have to.
